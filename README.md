# Professional Summary üõ†Ô∏èüìà
Hello! I‚Äôm Idus Eredia, an information security enthusiast, I'm on a dedicated cybersecurity learning journey, eager to hone my expertise, expand my skill set, and strengthen my ability to protect people and their data diligently.

## üìÑ View my resume [here](https://github.com/iduredia97/iduredia97/blob/main/IdusEredia%20CySec%20CV.pdf).

Since 2023, I have built a strong foundation in cybersecurity through focused study, hands-on labs, and industry certifications, with technical projects showcased on this GitHub portfolio. My practical experience includes internships and simulated SOC team exercises where I contributed to incident response, IAM, and monitoring tasks. Previously, as a Business Analyst at [Sapphital Learning](https://sapphital.com/), I managed website development with CMS tools, administered an LMS serving 100,000+ users, and served as a bridge between clients and technical teams. This combination of technical depth, analytical ability, and client-facing experience enables me to deliver value in cybersecurity operations while collaborating effectively across business and IT functions.
