I am a self-taught and highly motivated cyber security enthusiast. I enjoy solving problems that require me to use my background and new perspectives. My goal is to learn and expand my cybersecurity skill set so I can better protect people and their data. 
Here’s a polished and professional description of your experience that highlights your accomplishments and skills:

Since graduating in 2019 with a Bachelor’s degree in Finance, I have gained extensive professional experience working in two distinct roles that have significantly honed my technical and leadership competencies.

In my first role as a Data Analyst, I specialized in interpreting complex datasets using tools like SQL and Tableau, while also conducting advanced research to deliver actionable insights. This position allowed me to build a strong foundation in data visualization, analytics, and critical problem-solving.

In my second role, I transitioned into a leadership position, overseeing a multidisciplinary team of analysts that included IT operations professionals, product design teams, system administrators, and LMS specialists. This role involved coordinating cross-functional teams, optimizing workflows, and ensuring the successful delivery of strategic initiatives.

Additionally, I have embarked on a passion project, founding and developing my own eLearning platform. As part of this endeavor, I established and led a dedicated learning and development team to conduct needs assessments and instructional design. Together, we created dynamic eLearning resources tailored to a youthful demographic, leveraging blended learning systems to upskill youth across the African diaspora. This project reflects my commitment to driving impactful educational solutions and empowering underserved communities through innovative technologies and methodologies.

I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey in data analysis and computer science has led me to develop a rooted passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
